/**
 * This file contains tests for the Restful Booker app using Cypress (for API tests) and Grafana K6
 * (for performance).
 * The tests cover various functionalities of the app, such as login, booking, and updating bookings.
 * The tests are written using Cypress, a JavaScript end-to-end testing framework.
 * 
 * To run the tests, make sure the Restful Booker app is running locally or on a remote server.
 * Then, run the following command in the terminal:
 * 
 * $ npx cypress run
 * 
 * This will run all the tests in headless mode and generate a report in the terminal.
 * Alternatively, you can run the tests in interactive mode by running the following command:
 * 
 * $ npx cypress open
 * 
 * This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select and run individual tests.
